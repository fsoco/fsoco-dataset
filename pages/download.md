## Download

As of August 2022, the FSOCO dataset is publicly available for all Formula Student / FSAE teams and everyone who is interested in cone detection.
It is **not** necessary anymore to contribute before accessing the dataset.

You can download the public training datasets using the links below.
Please note that we provide the data in the [Supervisely](https://supervise.ly/ "Opens in a new tab."){:target="_blank"} format.
In order to convert it, please have a look at our [tools website]({{ "/tools/" | relative_url }}) and our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fsoco/fsoco-dataset).
